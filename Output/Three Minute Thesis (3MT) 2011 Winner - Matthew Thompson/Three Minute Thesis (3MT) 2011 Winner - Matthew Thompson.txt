 University of Queensland in the school of psychology and national ICT Australia faculty of social and behavioural Sciences the name of his thesis is structure and features in complex visual stimuli assisting identification in forensics and the short name for us here today has been translated to the 3-minute version suspect science and CSI would you please make Matthew very welcome I used to think that when a crime was committed the police dusted for fingerprints put them into a computer and up pop the driver's licence with a person who committed the crime right unfortunately it's not that easy country to what you see on CSA it's not computers that match prince it's humans this is a fingerprint Examiner and his job is to look back and forth at a pair of prints and decide whether the crime scene print matches the suspect my PhD thesis is about understanding how examiners make these important decisions in Australia alone there are over 5000 of these comparisons made per day to be used as evidence in convicting criminals but occasionally mistakes are made in 2004 a lawyer named Brandon Mayfield was arrested by the FBI because his fingerprints matched those found on a bomb that exploded killing 191 people but here's the catch the fingerprint examiners made a mistake they matched a print to the wrong person Mayfield was innocent so how can this happen will it turns out that despite them testifying in court for the past 100 years fingerprint examiners have never been scientifically tested for how accurately they can match prince in my PhD I started by testing the accuracy of fingerprint examiners at police stations in Queensland New South Wales Victoria South Australia and the Australian federal police in Canberra I put them in a situation similar to their tight experimental control by using simulated crime scene prints in a signal detection paradigm more simply I wanted to find out how many guilty people were being wrongly said free and how many innocent people were being wrongfully convicted this was the first ever test of fingerprint expertise and as you might hope the examiners were extremely accurate but not perfect I breathe the side relief when I saw that the examiners can actually do what they claim but the challenge now is to see how these findings translate to performance outside the lab as well as accuracy I'm interested in the basics of how it is that humans process complex visual patterns such as fingerprints I want to turn novices into experts more quickly and I'm discovering ways of improving their accuracy last month my research was presented to judge's at the Supreme Court the experiments from my PhD are changing the way we think about presenting fingerprint evidence to judges and juries so where to from here next year I'm heading to LA to continue my research with law enforcement agencies in the US I'll apply my fingerprint work across other areas of forensics like shoe prints bloods better and even DNA to help ensure that innocent people are not wrongfully accused thank you
