 Emily Johnstone from the School of Pharmacy and medical Sciences who presentation title is mosquito research saving lives with Paddy hose and paper clips I came to Australia to study the deadliest animal in the world now there may be some Australian audience members thinking spruce Sciences finally recognised the importance of the drop bears but I'm not studying drop bears because Around the World by transmitting diseases like malaria and dengue fever mosquitoes kill more than a million people every year making them the deadliest animal on the planet now in Australia the most common mosquito Borne disease is Ross river virus and it occurs at high rates in some areas but not others my question is why what is it about certain areas that makes them breed disease if we can understand the environmental factors that contribute to disease transmission but to answer that question I had to find out where the infected mosquitoes were in South Australia and traditionally testing mosquitoes four virus is always been difficult so I used a new technique it takes these cards which are embedded with virus preserving chemicals and Coats them in honey mosquitoes will come to feed on the honey and in the process spit virus onto the card where it can later be detected now no one had ever used this technique in a broad scale virus survey before so I had to adapt it I developed new traps and set them at over 100 field sites across South Australia and I captured over 20,000 hungry mosquitoes and let them feed on the card for a week before testing the cards for virus now you may not think that these traps look very impressive but science doesn't have to be beautiful it has to be effective and these traps are proving to be our most sensitive method of detecting infected mosquitoes I found three types of infection Ross river I need to conduct my analysis and I'm collecting publicly available data about the environment surrounding my traps like the density of human housing the biodiversity of mammals and the ratio of green space to buildings to see if any of those environmental factors can link these virus hotspots that I've shown here but the most exciting part of my research so far has been the success of this method public health officials in Victoria Queensland and Western Australia have been in contact with us about implementing this technique for their surveillance next year and I developed these traps in a tight budget I use recycled milk cartons pantyhose and paper clips to make the traps each trap cost less than a dollar and can be reused for the whole season that was important to me because the majority of mosquito Borne disease risk happens in economically impoverished countries in India for example where about a quarter of the population lives on a dollar a day there are 33 million cases of dengue infection every year what's my low budget virus surveillance and spatial analysis method I can help any country regardless of resources find out where their deadliest animals occur why they're there and how we can stop them from infecting humans thanks
